# Sphere SDK and applications

This repository contains the Sphere Java SDK and two Play 2.0 applications: the Merchant center (Scala) and the Sample store (Java).

There are three SBT projects contained in a single SBT multi-project build:

  - sphere-sdk
  - merchant-center
  - sample-store

The Sphere SDK talks to the Sphere backend services and both the Merchant center and the Sample store have a dependency on the SDK.

## Building and running

### Production

    cd sphere-applications
    sbt clean 'project merchant-center' compile stage
    ./merchant-center/target/start

### Development:

Once you have [Play 2.0.1](http://www.playframework.org/) installed:

    cd sphere-applications
    sbt
    $ project [merchant-center|sample-store]
    $ run

Go to localhost:9000 in your browser.

To stop the app, go back to the console and press CTRL+D.

#### Hot reloading

merchant-center and sample-store both depend on sphere-sdk. If you make changes to the merchant-center and refresh the browser, Play will automatically recompile merchant-center and the SDK. However, **if you only make changes to the SDK you need to restart the app** by CTRL+D, run.

## Configuration

Both the Merchant center and the Sample store have their Play configuration file in **/conf/application.conf**.

This configuration contains a section for configuring access to the Sphere backend services:


    # Main Sphere service:
    sphere.core="http://localhost:4242"

    # Sphere authorization service:
    sphere.auth="http://localhost:7777"

    # Name of your project:
    sphere.project="bias"

    # Id of your project, generated in the developer center:
    sphere.projectID="generated"

    # Authorization key for your project, generated by the developer center:
    sphere.projectSecret="generated"

## Logging

The Sphere SDK logs using slf4j logger called *sphere*. This log level for this logger is also configured in the Play configuration file (**/conf/application.conf**).

    # Logger used by the Sphere SDK
    logger.sphere=INFO
